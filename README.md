> [!NOTE]  
> A new version has been released. If you like.. old for some reason, you can use v1 but it's not optimized that well.
<p>plosLocal checks for the games <b>version.</b> Nothing else. Unfortunately, we do not use live updating. You MUST restart the server for the latest version.</p>
<p>plosLocal works by grabbing Roblox's API CheckForUpdates() and then printing that out. If you would like to add a UI to show the games version, you can. No copyright/DMCA action will be taken.</p>
<p>plosLocal is open source! Seriously, but the license  will tell what to do and not do.</p>
